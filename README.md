Question 1

1.1.

To make the function work correctly, we implement the swap function. It takes three arguments: the array (arr) and the indices i and j. The swap function is responsible for swapping two elements in the array.

1.2. 

Insertion sort is a comparison-based sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array one item at a time. It works by dividing the array into two parts: the sorted part and the unsorted part. The algorithm repeatedly takes the first unsorted element and compares it to the elements in the sorted part of the array. It then inserts this element into its correct position within the sorted part by shifting the larger elements to the right.

a. Best-case time complexity: O(n)
  The best-case scenario occurs when the input array is already sorted or nearly sorted. In this case, insertion sort is very efficient because it only needs to make a few comparisons and shifts. The best-case time complexity is linear, O(n), as it iterates through the array once.
b. Average-case time complexity: O(n^2)
 In the average case, insertion sort compares and shifts elements as needed. It involves nested loops, and the time complexity is quadratic, O(n^2). The average-case scenario assumes a random or unsorted input.
c. Worst-case time complexity: O(n^2)
 The worst-case scenario occurs when the input array is in reverse order. In this case, every element needs to be compared and shifted to the beginning of the sorted part. The worst-case time complexity is also quadratic, O(n^2).
 
1.3.

The function works correctly because the resulting sorted list is in ascending order.

1.4.

a. Insertion Sort:

   Efficiency: 
     - Best-case time complexity: O(n) - when the list is already sorted.
     - Worst-case time complexity: O(n^2) - when the list is sorted in reverse order.
     
   Use Cases:
     - Insertion sort is efficient for small lists or nearly sorted lists.
   
b. Bubble Sort:

  Efficiency:
     Best-case time complexity: O(n) - when the list is already sorted.
     Worst-case time complexity: O(n^2) - when the list is sorted in reverse order.
     
  Use Cases:
     Bubble sort is primarily used for small lists, educational purposes or understanding the basics of sorting algorithms.
 
c. Merge Sort:

   Efficiency:
    Best-case and worst-case time complexity: O(n log n) - it's more efficient than insertion and bubble sort for larger lists.
    
   Use Cases:
      Merge sort is efficient for sorting large lists or data that doesn't fit in memory, as it uses a divide-and-conquer approach.
      
1.5.

a. Efficiency in Nearly Sorted Lists:
   Insertion sort performs very well when the list is nearly sorted or already partially sorted.
   The best-case time complexity of insertion sort is O(n) when the list is already sorted, making it an efficient choice in this scenario.
   
b. Simplicity:
   Insertion sort is a straightforward and easy-to-understand algorithm. It doesn't require complex logic or additional data structures, which can be beneficial for quick implementation and debugging.
   
c. In-Place Sorting:
   - Insertion sort is an in-place sorting algorithm, meaning it doesn't require additional memory for sorting. This can be advantageous when you want to sort a list without using much extra memory.
   - 
d. Stability:
   Insertion sort is a stable sorting algorithm, which means it preserves the relative order of equal elements.

Question 2

a.	Linear Search:
Linear search is a searching algorithm that checks each element in a list or array one by one until the target element is found or all elements have been checked.
Linear search is a basic searching algorithm suitable for unsorted or small lists. It has a time complexity of O(n) in the worst case, where n is the number of elements.

b.	Binary Search:
Binary search is an efficient searching algorithm used for sorted lists or arrays. It repeatedly divides the search space in half and compares the target element to the middle element.
Binary search is highly efficient for sorted data, with a time complexity of O(log n) in the worst case. It's significantly faster than linear search for large datasets.

c.	Merge Sort:
 Merge sort is a comparison-based sorting algorithm that uses a divide-and-conquer approach to sort a list. It recursively divides the list into smaller sublists, sorts them, and merges them back together.
Merge sort is a sorting algorithm that achieves a stable, O(n log n) time complexity, making it efficient for general-purpose sorting.

d.	Quick Sort:
Quick sort is another efficient comparison-based sorting algorithm. It selects a "pivot" element, partitions the list into elements less than the pivot and elements greater than the pivot, and recursively sorts the sublists.
Quick sort is widely used for sorting because of its average-case O(n log n) time complexity, which makes it very efficient for large datasets. However, its worst-case time complexity is O(n^2).

Time Complexity:
The time complexity of the `find_max()` function is O(n), where n is the number of elements in the array. This is because it needs to iterate through the entire array once to find the maximum element.

Space Complexity:
The space complexity is O(1) because it uses a constant amount of additional memory, regardless of the size of the input array.
